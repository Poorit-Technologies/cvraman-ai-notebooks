## About

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for classroom teaching at **CV Raman Global University, Bhubaneswar** under the AI Center of Excellence program. New notebooks will be uploaded as the course progresses.

All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab** - a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment by Google that requires no local setup. You get free access to GPUs and a pre-configured Python environment.
